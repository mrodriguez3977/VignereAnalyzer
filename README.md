# VignereAnalyzer
This library can be used to both encrypt and decrypt using a vignere cypher in any language as well as analyze it for breaking the key used to encrypt a message.

In order to adapt this library to any other alphabet simply change the alphabet array to be whatever you desire it to be and change it so that it matches your alphabet, also you must change all the case statements so that the length of your alphabet is correct and each letter encryption and decryption works properly without having an indexOutOfBounds error.
